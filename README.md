## Getting Started

To explore any project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apurbaaaa/MLProjects.git
   cd MLProjects
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder and open the Jupyter notebooks to view code and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries, such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, which can be installed via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

Each notebook provides a walkthrough of the model development process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Users can experiment by altering parameters, adding new features, or trying alternative algorithms.
